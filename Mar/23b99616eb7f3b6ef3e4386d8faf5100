In a year when asset managers saw red on the markets, PSG Asset Management outpaced Ninety One to be named the best asset management firm in the country in the 27th edition of the Raging Bull awards. Ninety One, which was the asset management arm of Investec until 2020, has held the title of best manager for two consecutive years. It was ranked second in the latest awards, while H4 Collective Investments came in third place. PSG Asset management, although a significantly smaller player compared to Ninety One, is no stranger to the top three and has previously been placed second a number of times. At the end of August 2022, PSG had assets under management worth R41.9 billion, compared to R2.7 trillion at Ninety One.
