Transnet’s logistics struggles and South Africa’s worsening electricity crisis, which is hampering productivity and negatively affecting business, are among the top risks facing South Africa, according to FirstRand CEO Alan Pullinger.

He added that South Africa’s electricity crisis should be closely watched. “I think we must keep an eye on this load shedding. Whether it’s Stage 5 or Stage 6, there’s still a risk it could get worse,” he said. “An important risk … remains the underperformance of the energy sector, or alternately a very sharp slowdown in corporate revenues.… “Nevertheless, and more encouraging, is that there is a growing expectation that the private sector will need to be deeply involved in rebuilding and expanding the country’s productive capacity.” Read: FirstRand CEO slams SA’s ‘foolhardy’ ties with Russia Added to South Africa’s struggles, he said, are low levels of confidence, impacted by a combination of failing state-owned enterprises, crime and corruption, and low levels of governance and weakening institutional fabric, among other risks. “This combination does not foster an environment for business to commit long-term capital … “After all, investment requires a belief that the future will be better than the present.”
