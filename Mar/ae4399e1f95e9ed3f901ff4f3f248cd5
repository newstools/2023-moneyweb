Credit Suisse Group AG delayed the publication of its annual report and compensation details for 2022 after US regulators raised last-minute technical queries on previous statements. The Zurich-based lender was due to publish the reports on Thursday morning but received a late call from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday evening, the bank said in a statement. The SEC had comments and questions about revisions Credit Suisse made to cash-flow statements related to the financial years 2019 and 2020, as well as related controls, the bank said. Credit Suisse confirmed its 2022 financial results, previously released on February 9, adding that they are not affected by the regulators’ technical inquiries. No other regulators are involved, head of investor relations Kinner Lahkani said on a call with journalists. The bank did not disclose when it would publish the reports and said management believed it is “prudent to briefly delay” until they could better understand the nature of the regulators’ requests. © 2023 Bloomberg
