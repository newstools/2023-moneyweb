Increasing interest rates have slowed buyer activity as prices of medical commercial real estate remained firm over the last two quarters, but that is changing in 2023. Cap rates are moving slowly upwards as sellers are forced to accept lower prices in order to make returns more attractive to investors. After five months of waiting on the sidelines, OrbVest is back on the acquisition path having just secured a new core medical office investment in Duluth, Atlanta. The building is 100% leased by medical tenants. Particularly attractive is the fact that all leases are ‘triple net’, which means that all expenses are passed through to the tenants so dividend income is significantly more predictable in the current environment of uncertainty. The net rental income comfortably supports a 7% cash- on-cash return and an 11% internal rate of return.
