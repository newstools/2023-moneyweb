The rand firmed early on Friday ahead of closely watched US jobs data that could offer clues on the Federal Reserve’s next steps for monetary policy. Listen to the SAfm Market Update as Fifi Peters and RMB’s John Cairns discuss the scary levels the rand has recently seen and whether it will get worse:  At 0630 GMT, the rand traded at 18.53 to the dollar, almost 0.2% stronger than its previous close.
