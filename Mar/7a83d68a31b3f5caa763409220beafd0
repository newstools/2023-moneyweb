JSE-listed for-profit independent school group Curro says it plans to plough R800 million into capital projects to maintain, replace and expand facilities in the 2023 financial year. The group announced its growth plan to investors on Thursday as it released its review of its 2022 financial performance for the year ending 31 December 2022. The new tranche of investment is slightly lower than the amount the education group dedicated in the year under review. In 2022 Curro spent R1.1 billion on the business. This investment included the acquisition of HeronBridge College as well as several buildings in Cape Town and Randburg to support the group’s high-growth DigiEd schools. “Curro is in a healthy financial position, and it is on track to increase shareholder returns as the business matures,” the group said. “Our business remains resilient, and we are committed to continuing to provide an excellent education for all our learners.” The group added that in the short- to medium term, its main priority will be to increase the utilisation of its existing facilities. This shouldn’t be hard for the group as it has seen the number of students walk through its doors in 2022 increase, with the enrolment trajectory to continue  in 2023. In 2022, Curro welcomed 6.4% more children to its facilities, with the weighted number of learners recorded for the year coming in at 70 724. Additionally, despite the buying power of South African consumers dwindling as a result of high interest rates and inflation, demand for private education remains strong. According to the group, it had 73 047 registered learners by end of February 2023, compared to 70 408 learners around the same time in 2022.

The revenue growth was supported by the 14.1% increase in tuition fees that year. The group says the level of fee increases was necessitated by the growth in learner numbers and also covered expected annual fee increases. “Revenue growth was supported by an increase in ancillary revenue, which was R96 million and 36.1% higher than the previous year.” The group generated cash of R800 million from operating activities, which is 4% higher than in 2021. Profits for the year strengthened as recurring headline earnings per share (Heps) rose by 35% to 55.4 cents in 2022. A dividend of 11.08 cents per share was declared for the period, representing a 35% increase from the previous year.

In 2022, the group says it spent about R45 million in capex to mitigate load shedding – this included the installation of electricity meters to help track consumption and the installation of diesel generators for backup generation. Diesel spend amounted to R6 million for the period and with heightened levels of load shedding continuing into 2023, these costs may be on the rise in the coming financial year. As such, the group says part of its investment plan for 2023 involves a total capex spend of R46 million towards making the group less Eskom-dependent.
