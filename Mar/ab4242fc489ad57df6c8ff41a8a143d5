AB InBev SA, the world’s largest brewer, reported earnings that beat analysts’ estimates helped by sales of higher-end beer. Fourth-quarter earnings rose 7.6% before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation on an adjusted basis, the maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois said Thursday. Analysts expected 7.4% growth. Sales rose less than analysts expected as volume dropped in North America and Asia. The company has been under pressure amid weak consumption in the US and as Covid restrictions, which have now ended, crimped sales in China. The Leuven, Belgium-based company said it expects annual adjusted Ebitda growth of 4% to 8% in 2023. Analysts are expecting a gain of 7.6%.
