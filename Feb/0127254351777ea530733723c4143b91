The South African Revenue Service (Sars) has seized 300kg of pure cocaine – estimated to be worth R1.3 billion – from a container ship at the Durban harbour, the revenue collector said on Friday. The drug bust came after Sars and the South African Police Service (SAPS) partnered on week-long investigation of the ship which is believed to have come from South America.

All of these items have been handed over to the police for further investigation. “By working together, government has shown once again that it is determined to fight the scourge of narcotics entering the country and destroying the lives of its users, especially the youth,” said Sars commissioner Edward Kieswetter. “Sars will not tolerate these illegal activities but will rather continue to fulfil its mandate of facilitating legal trade to further economic development of our country,” added Kieswetter.
