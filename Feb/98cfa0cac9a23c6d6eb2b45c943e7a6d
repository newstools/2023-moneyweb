Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bulked up its investments in Apple, Paramount Global and Louisiana-Pacific Corp. even as it trimmed a number of positions across its portfolio. Paramount Global benefitted the most from Berkshire’s buying, with the conglomerate purchasing an additional 2.4 million shares worth more than $40 million as of December 31, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday. Apple remained the company’s largest holding by market value, though the value of that position fell by $7.4 billion in the period. The Paramount stake likewise lost market value in the period, falling $156 million. At the same time, Berkshire reduced financial holdings by selling shares in US Bancorp, Bank of New York Mellon Corp., and Ally Financial Inc. The company also cut back on its exposure to Activision Blizzard Inc. and chip-maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The remainder of the company’s portfolio was largely unchanged.
