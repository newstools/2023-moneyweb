Beira, Mozambique’s second-busiest port, halted operations Thursday as severe tropical storm Freddy was forecast to make landfall in the early hours of Friday. The port that’s located in the center of the country paused operations from Thursday morning and will resume at 7 p.m. local time Friday, weather conditions permitting. Cornelder de Moçambique, the operator, made the announcement in a note to clients posted to its Facebook page and confirmed to Bloomberg. Neighbouring Zimbabwe relies on Beira for imports including fuel. Meteo France forecast Freddy would strike Mozambique’s coast near Vilankulo, the tourist hotspot that’s about 150 miles south of Beira. © 2023 Bloomberg
