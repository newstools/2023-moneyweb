Specialist residential property developer Balwin Properties has announced plans to register a secondary listing on A2X Markets. Investors will be able to trade the property stock on the alternative market from Tuesday, 28 February. This means that Balwin Properties – which already has a primary listing on the JSE – will join market peers Attacq, Fairvest, Growthpoint Properties, Hyprop Investments, SA Corporate Real Estate and Stor-Age which all have secondary listings on the exchange. “We are pleased to be complementing Balwin’s existing listing on the JSE with a secondary listing on A2X,” Balwin CEO Steve Brookes said in a statement. “This listing offers investors greater access to our shares and could potentially attract new investors through lower trading costs offered on the A2X platform.” With Balwin’s listing, A2X will boast 95 listed instruments which account for a combined market capitalisation of R6.7 trillion.
