Despite an unsuccessful rates appeal with the City of Joburg (CoJ), related to the 2018 municipal valuation of its flagship Sandton City property, JSE-listed Liberty Two Degrees (L2D) is considering appealing the valuation of the property in the city’s latest 2023 valuation roll. L2D CEO Amelia Beattie revealed this in an interview with Moneyweb on Monday, following the release of the group’s latest annual results. She said the city’s valuation of Sandton City back in 2018 was R10 billion. However, L2D has been in dispute with the city over this and caught up in a long-running appeals process over the last five years. On 20 February 2023, the group confirmed that it had lost its appeal with the CoJ’s Valuation Appeal Board. “Despite being unsuccessful with the [2018] appeal, we are looking at our options and are considering appealing the CoJ’s valuation of Sandton City in the latest 2023 valuation roll,” said Beattie. She added that the city had oddly kept Sandton City’s latest valuation “flat” at R10 billion. However, she said L2D is considering “going through the process” as part of commenting on the new 2023 valuation roll, as the group “still does not agree with the city’s valuation” of the landmark property. “We believe Sandton City’s property valuation is around R7.5 billion,” said Beattie.

With Sandton City still being valued by the CoJ at R10 billion, it means the city would have charged L2D rates at that level, even during Covid-19 when commercial property valuations took a hammering. Last year, CoJ threatened to cut off municipal services like water and electricity to several properties in Sandton (including Sandton City) due to unpaid rates. However, L2D stressed at the time that it was up to date, barring the disputed rates part of the bill. Read:

Joburg won’t demand rates on disputed valuations – Mashaba [April 2018] While L2D’s CEO confirmed on Monday that Sandton City’s 2023 municipal valuation remains at the 2018 level of R10 billion, the CoJ’s latest valuation roll (currently out for comment) is on average 12% higher than in 2018. Rates impact L2D losing its five-year rates appeal with CoJ has had a post year-end impact on its 2022 financial performance and dividend payout to shareholders. Beattie says L2D will need to pay the city R67 million more in rates. The group on Monday declared an annual dividend of 36.47 cents per share for FY2022, which represents 100% of distributable income. Distribution or dividend per share (dps) growth came in at 6.95%. “Notification was received post year end that the Sandton City rates appeal has been unsuccessful. Consequently, provision for the arrear rates and interest has been made, resulting in a net impact of approximately 2 cents per share on the distribution per share for the financial year ended 31 December 2022,” L2D noted in its JSE results release. Beattie tells Moneyweb this effectively means that had it not been for the additional rates charges, shareholders would have received a dividend of 38.47 cents per share or 2 cents per share more. This would have also seen L2D achieving double-digit dps growth for FY2022 of around 13%. “Going forward, we will have to pass on these additional charges to our tenants as best as we can … Tenants and shareholders ultimately bear the brunt of such increases,” she adds.

Besides Sandton City, the group’s other major assets include Eastgate Shopping Centre, Liberty Midlands Mall, and stakes in Nelson Mandela Square and Melrose Arch. “The portfolio generated a 21.9% increase in turnover compared to 2021 [18.3% vs 2019] and recorded a 24.9% growth in footcount compared to 2021 [9.9% vs 2019],” the group said. “Higher demand for retail space resulted in improved retail occupancy rates and positive leasing outcomes, providing an enhanced customer experience. Although the office recovery has been muted, the office portfolio occupancy rate has improved on a like-for-like basis. “Portfolio reversions, while still negative, have improved considerably to -10.4% from -25.9% in the prior period,” it noted. “However, continued double-digit increases in administered municipal and utility costs, coupled with increased periods of load shedding prevailed in 2022 and remain a concern.”
