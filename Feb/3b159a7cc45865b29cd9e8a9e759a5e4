Motorists are in for another big petrol price increase from Wednesday, 1 March, on the back of short supply globally, the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy said. The energy department has confirmed price increases of 1.27 per litre for petrol. In a statement the department cited scant supply across the globe and other factors such as the closure of refineries in some parts of the world, as reasons for the increases. Higher freight rates and propane and butane prices are also contributing to the increases in LPGas prices, which saw a jump of over R5.

The impact of the EU sanctions on diesel imports from Russia was already priced in,” it said. “These factors led to higher contributions to the basic fuel prices of petrol by 73.89 c/l and lower contributions to the BFP (basic fuel price) of diesel and illuminating paraffin by 26.48 c/l and 40.90 c/l, respectively,” the department said. The rand/dollar exchange rate led to higher contributions to the basic fuel prices of petrol, diesel, and illuminating paraffin by 48.26 c/l, 52.53 c/l, and 53.56 c/l respectively. During the review period the rand depreciated against the dollar, from R17.05 to R17.74. The department also implemented a slate levy increase of 4.38 cents per litre to 21.92 cents per litre which will be integrated into the price structure of diesel and petrol as of Wednesday, in line with the Self-Adjusting Slate Levy Mechanism rules. By the end of January, the negative slate balance on petrol and diesel came to R2.7 billion, the energy department said.
