The National Treasury adopted quite the optimistic tone on the country’s expected economic growth this year, forecasting GDP growth for 2023 at 0.9% – exactly three times higher than the central bank’s expectations. Read/watch the 2023 Budget speech In 2022, the country’s economy grew by 2.5% – higher than the 1.9% projection tabled by Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana in the 2022 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS). According to the finance ministry, the upwards revision of growth in 2022 was supported by high commodity prices as well as stronger third-quarter performances reported by the agriculture and service sectors. At the first Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting of 2023, the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) Governor Lesetja Kganyago pinned the central bank’s projections for the year at a mere 0.3% because of the devastating impact of heightened load shedding on the economy.

Especially as Treasury’s growth forecasts for the coming years come in around double that put out by the Sarb earlier this year. National Treasury says it expects GDP to strengthen in 2024 to 1.5% and a further 1.8% in 2025, significantly higher than the Sarb’s forecast of 0.7% in 2024 and 1% in 2025. Treasury’s optimism comes despite the country battling the worst bout of load shedding which, according to Treasury documents, has seen the amount of load-shed hours recorded between 2021 and 2022 more than doubling to 3 782 hours. With headline inflation having peaked in 2022 at 6.9%, Treasury has forecasted consumer price inflation (CPI) easing in 2023 to 5.3% and 4.9% in 2024, edging closer to headline inflation recorded in years prior to 2022. Eskom bailout hikes debt Progress seems to be on the cards in terms of the country’s budget deficit, as National Treasury says it expects this to drop to 4.2% in 2022/23 and even lower to 3.2% in 2025/25, from the 4.6% reported in the previous period. Government expects to achieve a main budget primary surplus in the 2022/3 period. However, due to the state’s decision to provide Eskom with a R254 billion bailout – which is meant to help the struggling power utility stay afloat and manage its more-than-R400 billion debt – National Treasury has cautioned that it will take a little longer for the country’s debt to stabilise. “This arrangement, subject to strict conditions, will relieve extreme pressure on the utility’s balance sheet, enabling it to conduct necessary maintenance,” acting director-general Ismail Momoniat noted in the budget review document. “It also supports restructuring the electricity market to help South Africa establish a stable, uninterrupted power supply as it transitions to a clean energy future,” Momoniat added. Eskom’s bailout In the 2022 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS), Godongwana said that government expected state debt to stabilise at 75.1% of GDP in the 2024/25 financial year. However, partly because of Eskom’s massive cash-injection, debt is now expected to stabilise at 73.6% of GDP in 2025/25 financial, both later and at a higher level than previously announced. Read: Eskom to get a massive R254bn in debt relief Eskom’s bailout will also lead to an increase in debt-servicing costs, with projections averaging at R366.8 billion, over the medium term, while the costs will peak at R397.1 billion in 2025/26 financial period. With this reality, the finance minister says his department will have to adopt a prudent fiscal policy stance to prevent a further allocation of public resources to debt. “Mainly due to this Eskom debt relief, government debt will stabilise at a higher level of 73.6 per cent of GDP and in 2025/26. This is three years later than anticipated in the 2022 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement,” Godongwana says. Risks “In general, government debt is high. The gross debt stock is projected to increase from R4.73 trillion in 2022/23 to R5.84 trillion in 2025/26. And because debt is high, our debt-service costs are also high.” “There are risks to the fiscal outlook. These include a worsening of the economic outlook, a further weakening of the finances of state-owned companies, and an unaffordable public-service wage agreement. If these risks materialise, they will require us to make difficult budgeting trade-offs,” Godongwana adds.
