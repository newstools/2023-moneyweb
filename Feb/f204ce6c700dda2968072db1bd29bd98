Financial services group Alexforbes has appointed Thabo Dloti as its acting chairperson following the resignation of Daniel Mminele, who takes up the role of chair of Nedbank later this year. Dloti, who has served as a director at Alexforbes for nearly 15 years, will assume the role of interim chair from 1 May, subject to regulatory approval, the company said in a note to shareholders on Wednesday. Since September 2022, Dloti has been serving as the company’s lead independent director, chair of the remuneration committee, and has been a member of the nominations committee. He has also served within Alexfobes’s mergers and acquisitions, and social, ethics and transformation committees. Dloti was previously life insurance group Liberty’s CEO and is currently the chairman of short-term insurance provider, Rand Mutual. He is also the chairman of African Bank. His appointment as chair of Alexforbes comes as Mminele leaves the company to join Nedbank as an independent non-executive director and chairperson-designate. His resignation from Alexforbes is effective from 30 April, with his independent non-executive director and chairperson roles set to begin on 1 May and 2 June respectively. “The board expresses its regret regarding Mr Mminele’s brief tenure, but is sincerely grateful for the meaningful contribution, dedication and effort since his appointment as chair-designate on 1 January 2022, especially during a critical period of shareholder transition for the company in 2022,” Alexforbes said. “The board thanks Mr Mminele and wishes him well for the future,” the company said.
