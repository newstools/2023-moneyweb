South Africa’s tourism agency is in discussions with stakeholders to pursue a partnership deal with English football club Tottenham Hotspur. Talks were ongoing when information on the deal was prematurely leaked, according to Themba Khumalo, acting chief executive officer of SA Tourism. “This envisaged deal is not asking the fiscus to introduce new money into our budget,” he told reporters on Thursday. “In January we presented this opportunity to the board.” The proposed deal came under heavy scrutiny with government being criticised for possibly using public funds to sponsor a foreign football team at a time when the country is grappling with high unemployment, rising inflation and intensified rotational power cuts. While no agreement has been signed with the entity, the deal was approved by the board, Khumalo said.
