As South Africa’s sclerotic electricity grid lurches the country into darkness, energy security is going to be the preoccupying national theme of 2023. Without energy, nothing moves. Businesses that have not already adopted a Plan B for energy are now doing so out of necessity. Generator and solar panel sales are booming. Read all our Eskom coverage here. Based on Eskom’s track record, we can probably safely dismiss any happy talk that the grid can be stabilised within six months or even two years. The neglect of our electricity infrastructure is so inter-generational, the very best engineers we have are telling us that a full rescue is at least a decade away. In the meantime, Eskom customers who can afford it are weaning themselves off eight hours-a-day load shedding by adopting alternative power generation solutions. Solar and wind will not solve SA’s energy problems, other than on a very localised level. The supply is too intermittent to feed a grid that demands constant baseload power. Like it or not, power generation from oil and gas will boom in 2023 and beyond. The Petroleum Agency SA (Pasa) reckons the country has 27 billion barrels of oil and 60 trillion cubic feet of gas off our coast. Some promising gas and condensate finds have been made off the south coast of SA by TotalEnergies, while Tetra 4, owned by US-based Renergen, tapped a decent-sized reserve of natural gas and helium in the Free State and last year started supplying liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the local market. That’s all very encouraging, but where do we go from here? These are five energy trends to watch in 2023: Zwelakhe Mabece is CEO of Outflow Petroleum Insights.
