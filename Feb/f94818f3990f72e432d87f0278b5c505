I’ll be very grateful if you can assist with advice. I’m 73 years old and considering RSA Retail Bonds as an investment in a fixed deposit for 60 months. I have no knowledge about it, and want to know:  Dear reader, Thanks for writing to us. The safety of government bonds in South Africa depends on a variety of factors, including the overall stability of the economy, the government’s ability to repay its debt, and the political and social climate in the country. In recent years, South Africa has faced significant economic and political challenges, including high levels of debt, low growth, and political uncertainty. These challenges have led to concerns about the safety of government bonds and the ability of the government to repay its debt. However, it’s important to note that government bonds are considered a relatively safe investment, as they are backed by the government. Additionally, the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb), the country’s central bank, has taken steps to support the stability of the economy, which may provide some assurance to investors. Advantages Safety: RSA Retail Savings Bonds are considered a safe investment option, as they are backed by the government. This means the bonds are less likely to default, and your investment is secure. In saying this, there is always risk involved when investing. The safety of government bonds in South Africa depends on a variety of factors, including the overall stability of the economy, the government’s ability to repay its debt, and the political and social climate in the country. Guaranteed returns: The returns on RSA Retail Savings Bonds are guaranteed, and the interest rate is set at the time of purchase. This means that you know exactly how much money you will receive, making it easier to plan your finances. Below are the February rates: Guaranteed Income: You can choose to have the interest paid out to you monthly. The capital will be repaid after the period. Disadvantages Low returns: The returns on RSA Retail Savings Bonds are relatively low when compared with equity funds over the last 10 years. Liquidity: RSA Retail Savings Bonds are fixed for a certain amount of time (a two-, three- or five-year period) and you will only have access to the capital after a 12-month period. Inflation risk: The interest rate on RSA Retail Savings Bonds may not keep pace with inflation, which means that the purchasing power of your investment may decrease over time. Sarb’s inflation target band is between 3% and 6%, but this level was breached in early 2022. If you bought a two-year bond in February 2022, the rate was 5.5%. The consumer price index (CPI) is currently 7.2%. You would’ve made a real return of -1.7%. If you bought a three-year bond, the rate was 7.25%. Your real return would be +0.05%.

As with any investment, it’s important to carefully consider the risks involved and seek professional advice before making a decision. Additionally, it’s a good idea to diversify your investments and not rely solely on government bonds for your financial security.
