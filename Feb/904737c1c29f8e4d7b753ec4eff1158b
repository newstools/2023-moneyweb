The rand slipped against a stronger dollar early on Wednesday ahead of the release of local inflation, business confidence and retail sales figures later in the day. At 08:58, the rand traded at R17.98 against the dollar. The dollar was up about 0.2% against a basket of global currencies. Statistics South Africa will publish January consumer inflation figures at 0800 GMT and December retail sales at 1100 GMT. The South African Chamber of Commerce and Industry will publish its January business confidence index at 0930 GMT. All three releases could influence rand trading if they bring in surprises, after the local currency has mainly tracked global factors so far this week. Economists polled by Reuters predict inflation to ease to 6.9% in annual terms in January from 7.2% in the prior month, while they expect retail sales to contract 0.1% in December after a 0.4% growth in November. The South African governmentâ€™s benchmark 2030 bond was weaker in early deals, with the yield up 6 basis points at 9.900%.
