State-owned fuel pipeline subsidiary Transnet Pipelines says it has recorded 90 fuel theft incidents and made 68 arrests since the beginning of its current financial year. This follows another fuel theft attempt over the weekend which resulted in the deaths of two perpetrators. Their bodies were found, one in “the structure” and one in the tunnel leading to Transnet’s petroleum pipeline near Kibler Park, Johannesburg. Transnet Pipelines says it suspects that the perpetrators were “overcome by fumes” during an attempt to siphon petrol from the pipeline on Saturday evening. It says both the structure and the tunnel were demolished on Sunday. “The incident over the weekend is a harsh reminder to perpetrators that tampering with the petroleum pipelines and associated infrastructure can lead to disastrous consequences, including personal injuries and fatalities, extensive environmental damage and fire,” the subsidiary notes in a statement issued on Monday. It says the arrests made in connection with fuel theft attempts show its commitment to halting criminal activities and keeping its pipelines and communities safe. “The perpetrators will face the full might of the law as tampering with the pipeline, or colluding to tamper, is a schedule 5 offence in terms of the Criminal Matters Amendment Act, Act 18 of 2015 and all perpetrators are charged accordingly.” The state-owned subsidiary is urging petroleum retailers and members of the public to refrain from buying fuel from unregistered traders, to limit the demand for illegal petroleum products and to join in the fight against fuel theft. “Transnet will act with the full might of the law to deal with all would-be perpetrators and organised crime syndicates planning to steal fuel from the pipeline network.” Nondumiso Lehutso is a Moneyweb intern.
