BNP Paribas SA’s Frankfurt offices were raided by German prosecutors as part of their vast investigation into the controversial Cum-Ex scandal that has swept up Wall Street’s biggest banks. A spokesperson for the bank confirmed the search and said it’s cooperating. A Cologne prosecutors’ spokesman said the agency was raiding a bank in Frankfurt since Tuesday without disclosing its name. The search was reported earlier by Handelsblatt. Cum-Ex was a trading strategy across Europe that siphoned off billions of euros in government revenue, by taking advantage of tax laws that seemed to allow multiple investors to claim refunds of a tax on dividends that was paid only once. Germany moved to abolish the practice in 2012. While dating back more than a decade, the Cum-Ex scandal continues to roil the financial industry. Prosecutors in Cologne are investigating more than 1,500 people and are ramping up the pressure on international banks.
