The rand was flat early on Thursday, as investors awaited US inflation data, which could determine whether the Federal Reserve will slow the pace of its policy tightening and ease the pressure on global central banks. At 09:40, the rand traded at R16.95 against the dollar. The annual reading for US CPI is expected to show a decline to 6.5% in December from 7.1% in the prior month, according to Refinitiv data. “Should it surprise to the downside, it will have major implications for the dollar that will likely come under tremendous pressure,” ETM Analytics said in a research note. “The opposite also holds true, but to a lesser extent, given just how much has already been priced into the market,” it added. The risk-sensitive rand often takes its cues from global drivers such as the US monetary policy in the absence of major local events. The government’s benchmark 2030 bond was almost unchanged in early deals, with the yield at 9.855%.
