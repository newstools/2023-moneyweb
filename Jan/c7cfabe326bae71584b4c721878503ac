South Africa’s current bout of intense rolling blackouts threatens to further weigh on economic activity, weaken business confidence and weigh on investment, according to Absa. While state-owned power utility Eskom has implemented outages in Africa’s most-industrialised economy for almost two decades, it has for the past seven days subjected the country to record blackouts — as much as 12 hours a day — to protect the power grid from collapse as its ageing, mostly coal-fired power plants fail. Short-term solutions to alleviate the crisis have yet to be announced. “I don’t know and I don’t think Eskom knows how quickly they’re going to be able to sustainably scale back load shedding from Stage 6,” said Peter Worthington, a senior economist at the Johannesburg-based lender, referring to the outages in which 6 000 megawatts of power is removed from the grid. In fact, in a power alert issued later on Monday afternoon Eskom said the intensity of power cuts would be reduced to Stage 4 from 05:00 and 16:00 on Tuesday, and Stage 5 from 16:00 to 05:00.

Modelling based on historic data doesn’t account for companies having back-up power supply or retooling production processes to deal with outages, and cumulative damage to the economy’s growth potential from investment lost due to persistent power rationing, he said. South Africa’s statistics office is considering including self-generated power in its monthly electricity-generation data.
