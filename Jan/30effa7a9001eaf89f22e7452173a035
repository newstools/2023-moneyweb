Clicks Group on Tuesday reported slower turnover growth for the 20-week period to January 15 reflecting a sharp fall in Covid-19 vaccinations.

The beauty retailer generated just R4 million from vaccinations versus R685 million a year earlier. Clicks did not share further detail on this. Its total retail sales grew by 5.5% and by 12.2% excluding vaccinations. After more than 4 million Covid-19 infections and over 102 000 deaths, hospitalisation and mortality rates have come down significantly in South Africa. As of January 23, over 38 million vaccinations had been administered. Turnover at United Pharmaceutical Distributors (UPD) – its bulk and wholesale division – grew by 9.9% as sales managed for bulk distribution clients benefited from new contracts and growth in existing clients.
