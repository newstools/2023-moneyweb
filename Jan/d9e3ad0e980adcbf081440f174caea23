African Media Entertainment (AME) has appointed Rob Fedder as Moneyweb’s new managing director (MD). Moneyweb is a subsidiary of JSE-listed AME. Fedder joined the Moneyweb board as a non-executive director late last year and will now be involved with the operational and strategic direction of the company moving forward. “He comes with a wealth of strategic leadership, and we are excited to have him join the team, to drive the Moneyweb brand to even greater reach and profitability,” said AME CEO Dave Tiltmann. Fedder has significant executive experience, with nearly 20 year’s experience in various companies and industries. He is also a non-executive director of AME, a group executive of Caxton & CTP, a divisional director of Spark Media, and the CEO of Cognition. He started his entrepreneurial journey as an entrepreneur running a startup business. He joined Tidy Files in 2006 and became the operations director after a management buyout. Metrofile acquired the company a few years later, following which he became the MD of Tidy Files and Cleardata. Fedder joined Caxton CTP in 2021 and soon took the reins at Cognition and Spark Media. “I am excited to join the team as I have always enjoyed and benefitted from Moneyweb’s excellent editorial content,” Fedder said. “I look forward to working with the editorial team and investing in journalism to establish Moneyweb as the preferred business media platform in the country.”
